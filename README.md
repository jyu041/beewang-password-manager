# Introduction:
The BeeWang-Password-Manager password manager is a python console based software that allows multiple users to store their login details for different websites they visit, each user can store up to nine-thousand nine-hundred and ninety nine login details, once that fills up, the users would need to make a new account(I don't think anyone would have 9999 accounts anyway)

# Requirements:
This software was mainly tested in Windows Python 3.7.3, it is not guranteed that this software can be ran in different environments. 
Uses the following libraries:
 - string
 - os
 - sys
 - hashlib
 - base64
 - time
 - math
 - random (not used at all but i forgot to remove)
 
 Internet is **not** required for the software to run
 
 # Notes:
 This software took me few whole days to code, please be polite and not claim it as your own xD
 
 Some special features in this software is limited to only windows, so users on other platforms, I am truly sorry, this would need improvement. I have made this program so that all the code is stored in one file, so that it is "portable", would be very easy to move this file around to different directories instead of copying and pasting a whole folder of files.
 
 There are couple customizable settings inside the file that can be changed, only change them if you understand what you are doing, otherwise it could cause damage to your device.
